# FRIedmann Solver for Black Hole Evaporation in the Early universe

Friedmann - Boltzmann Equation solver for Primordial Black Holes + SM radiation +  Dark Radiation. See arXiv.2207.xxxxx.
We consider the collapse of density fluctuations as the PBH formation mechanism.

The main class in "SolFBEqs_PBH.py" returns the full evolution of the PBH, SM and DR comoving energy densities,
together with the evolution of the PBH mass and spin as function of the scale factor.

The example script "DNeff.py" containts the final determination of DNeff depending on the model parameters.
